ABOUT
=====
bookmark-djvu and bookmark-djvu-extract are wrappers around DjVuLibre's
djvused(1) program. They allow for the simple modification and extraction
of DjVu outlines (aka. bookmarks).

INSTALL
=======
you only need djvused:

Debian, Ubuntu:
$ apt-get install djvulibre-bin

Fedora:
$ yum install djvulibre perl-Test-Simple

USAGE
=====
run './bookmark-djvu --help' and './bookmark-djvu-extract --help' for usage
and commandline option information.


INPUT/OUTPUT FORMAT
===================
example input file:
%< %< %< %< %< %< %< %< %< %<

Cover 1
Preface . . . 3
d=4
Chapter 1 1

    Subsect 1.1 ......2
    Subsect 1.2 3
        SubSubsect 1.2.1	4

%< %< %< %< %< %< %< %< %< %< 

each outline item is of the form
<INDENTATION> <TITLE> <SEPARATOR> <PAGE-NUMBER>.

Page numbering starts with 1.

Child outline items are indented with four spaces.

A line of the form 'd=NUMBER' will add NUMBER to all following PAGE-NUMBERS
until the next 'd=NUMBER' marker or the end of file. NUMBER can be negative.

The separator between <TITLE> and <PAGE-NUMBER>  consists of dots and/or
whitespace.

Blank lines are ignored.

<TITLE> has to be encoded in UTF-8.

Note that with this format it's impossible to have trailing dots
or whitespace in a title. Also it's impossible to have newlines in titles.
Maybe we will provide YAML as an input/output format in the future.

TESTS
=====
the tests are run with
$ cd t/ && ./test
